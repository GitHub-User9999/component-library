1. Create the About Page File

Inside your app directory, add a new folder about with a page.tsx (or page.jsx) file:

/app
 ├─ /about
 │   └─ page.tsx


---

2. Basic About Page Example

// app/about/page.tsx
export default function AboutPage() {
  return (
    <main className="max-w-3xl mx-auto p-6">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">About This Library</h1>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        This component library was built to provide reusable, accessible, and 
        customizable UI elements for modern web applications. 
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        It is designed to be developer-friendly, with a focus on simplicity, 
        performance, and flexibility. Each component follows best practices 
        for accessibility and can be easily integrated into new or existing projects.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg">
        Whether you’re building dashboards, portfolios, or full-scale applications, 
        this library gives you the building blocks you need to get started quickly.
      </p>
    </main>
  );
}

3. Update Navigation

If you already have a navigation bar (like in /components/NavBar.tsx), add a link to /about:

import Link from "next/link";

export function NavBar() {
  return (
    <nav className="flex space-x-4 p-4 bg-gray-100">
      <Link href="/">Home</Link>
      <Link href="/components">Components</Link>
      <Link href="/contact">Contact</Link>
      <Link href="/about">About</Link>
    </nav>
  );
}

4. (Optional) Enhance with Metadata

You can add custom metadata for SEO by using generateMetadata in page.tsx:

export const metadata = {
  title: "About - Component Library",
  description: "Learn more about the vision and goals behind this component library.",
};
